# PROJ631-HuffmanCoding
## Introduction
Huffman coding is a method of data compression. Its principle is to replace a character with a sequence of bits of variable length. The idea is to encode what is frequent in a few bits and what is rare in longer sequences of bits. It allows lossless compression, that is to say a sequence of bits strictly identical to the original is restored by decompression. 
## How Does It Works ?
In order to use the code correctly, we invite you to follow the few steps below :
1. Put the file you want to compress in the *assets* folder.
2. Run the program.
3. Write the name of the file in the terminal (with the extension).
4. After pressing *enter* several things appear :
    - A BINARY file named *nameOfFile_comp.bin* containing the compressed text is generated in the *results* folder.
    - A TEXT file named *nameOfFile_freq.txt* containing the compressed text alphabet is generated in the *results* folder.
    - The compression ratio and the average number of encoding bits are displayed.
5. Press any key to end the programme.
